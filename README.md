## Quick Start

To quickest way to run code in this repo is to use the following steps. First, you must have the `conda`  
package manager installed (e.g., via Anaconda). However, I recommend using `mamba`, via [miniforge]
(https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) as it is faster and more lightweight than `conda`. Second, you 
must have TexLive (or another LaTeX distribution) installed on your computer and available in your path.
You can do this by downloading and 
installing it from here ([windows](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html#install) 
and [mac](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) installers).
Having done these things, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project and create a 
conda environment using the following command:
```
conda create -n fastapi python=3.12
conda activate fastapi
```
and then install the dependencies with pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Finally, you can then run 
```
python main.py
```
And that's it!



### Dependencies and Virtual Environments

#### Working with `pip` requirements

`conda` allows for a lot of flexibility, but can often be slow. `pip`, however, is fast for what it does.  You can install the requirements for this project using the `requirements.txt` file specified here. Do this with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements file can be created like this:
```
pip list --format=freeze
```

#### Working with `conda` environments

The dependencies used in this environment (along with many other environments commonly used in data science) are stored in the conda environment called `fast` which is saved in the file called `environment.yml`. To create the environment from the file (as a prerequisite to loading the environment), use the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Now, to load the environment, use

```
conda activate fast
```

Note that an environment file can be created with the following command:

```
conda env export > environment.yml
```

However, it's often preferable to create an environment file manually, as was done with the file in this project.

Also, these dependencies are also saved in `requirements.txt` for those that would rather use pip. Also, GitHub actions work better with pip, so it's nice to also have the dependencies listed here. This file is created with the following command:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Other helpful `conda` commands**

- Create conda environment from file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Activate environment for this project: `conda activate fast`
- Remove conda environment: `conda remove --name fast --all`
- Create fast conda environment: `conda create --name myenv --no-default-packages`
- Create fast conda environment with different version of Python: `conda create --name myenv --no-default-packages python` Note that the addition of "python" will install the most up-to-date version of Python. Without this, it may use the system version of Python, which will likely have some packages installed already.
